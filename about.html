                I had a terrible camping experience when I was younger. I felt uncomfortable in my sleeping bag and
                forgot to bring some important necessities. I also had to fight for my life against bugs. In addition
                 to my traumatic experience, there was nothing much for me to do outdoors. However, if I had gathered 
                 all my information before camping, I guaranteed my camping experience would be different. So, I designed 
                 the website “Tent Tales”, to help first time campers or those who want to try again, to prepare them for
                  the great outdoors. My goal is to help them feel comfortable while exploring the beauty of nature.
